Additional Info:
    - Semester info:
        - 1 or more semesters can be listed, each separated by a comma
        - if there are no semester limitations, then the default value should be 0
    - Priority
        - is subject to change within the program
    - Coreq Data
        - Contains info on how many coreqs there are and their types
        - any positive integer ( >= 0 ) indicates the number of corequisite courses a course has
        - '-1' indicates that the coreq is a certain amount of credits
        - '-2' indicates that the fulfillment of a requirement is a coreq
        - If different types of coreqs exist for a course, then their types are separated by commas
    - Prereq Data
        - all of the same as the coreq data, except '-2' is not evaluated
    - Coreqs:
        - if coreq courses exist, list their courseIDs
        - if a requirement coreq exist, list the requirement title
        - if a credits coreq exist, list the number of credits required
        - Note: If multiple types of coreqs exist, then the order they are listed
            in MUST follow the order that their data was entered in in coreq_data
        - Note: If more than one coreq exists, use a single space to separate each one
    - Prereqs :
        - same as coreqs, without the requirements prereq allowed

TODO : Add the capability of listing more than one requirement as the coreq
TODO: Add -2 as a requirement prereq
