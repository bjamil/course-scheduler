- is this a black box search ?

- sets difficulty of geneds to 3 :s 


<<<<<<< .mine
- 10/23/2010: Changes:
    - added catalog as a paramter of Schedule constructor
    - modified schedule.clone to suit those changes
    - defaulted difficulty to 1

- make it so that, apart from schedule, all classes store courseID only. better information hiding. ?

>>>>>>> .r60
- what should be done with the semester attribute if a course has been taken prior to schedule generation ..

- what if only one part of a corequisite is marked as a corequisit needed? :s cs101, cs112 -- or for 306? all gened? 

x- we need to make degree of difficulty more adaptable to other universities (way way future)

- Do we really need pointers if we use maps?

- Change the arraylists of course objects to Maps 

X- add a degree class?

X- Idea:
        1. load in information on ALL possible courses (except all gen ed ones b/c that would be too much ... )
            and store them in some arraylists .
        2. Extract a subset of those arraylists based on the requirements (so, extract all required courses, 3 senior electives, etc ... )
        3. generate schedule with the subset from 2.
        Note: This will require a modification of the input txt file.
